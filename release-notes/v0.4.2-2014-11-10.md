# v0.4.2

* Patches:
    * created a central message creator that is used by all adapters
        * logging `new Error('whoops');` will now show a `[Error: whoops]` in the logs (and not `{}`).
        * logging `JSON.stringify(obj, null, 4);` will now result in a correctly formatted output.
        * logging an object will log that object stringified on one line.
        * logging an object with circular references will show `[Circular]` at those references and not error out.
    * adapters can have multiple instances (e.g. logging to 2 files).
    * Console:
        * replaced `colors` with `chalk`, so that the string prototype can be left intact
        * replaced italics with underline, since italics was not showing up on many terminals
