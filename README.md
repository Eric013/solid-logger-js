# What am I?

solid-logger-js is a project that will create logs in a consistant way between your projects. There are a ton of options
when implementing logging in your application. The solid-logger series implements the same tasks across programming
languages. The idea is that logging in node projects is identical to php, ruby, etc.


# Why do you want to use me?

Logging is crucially important and necessary for all applications. If a standard practice is not adopted then each
 team will implement their own way of doing it. Solid logger will not only log to a file, but you can implement
 adapters that will save data to other databases or TO THE CLOUD!!! The API can also act as a gateway to
 present the logs in various ways through a web interface (separate project).


# How can I be made more useful?

If you want to contribute to this project you could add in more adapters for different output types or implement a new
language that uses the same interface and configurations (so that we maintain a consistant feel).

# Methods

* write
* error
* warn
* trace
* debug

# Adapters
